          <p class="mt-3">
            If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not access or use the Services.

          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            You may use the Services only if you:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">

            2.2 Nature of the Service
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Our role is to provide information, guidance, and comparison of connectivity options from various Providers. We are not a carrier, Internet service provider, or reseller of bandwidth. Any order you place for DIA or other connectivity services will be governed by a separate agreement between you and the applicable Provider.
          </p>

            2.3 No Guarantee of Availability or Pricing
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-2">
            All information we provide regarding serviceability, pricing, terms, speed tiers, SLAs, or implementation timelines is based on data obtained from third-party Providers and other sources believed to be reliable at the time presented. However, we do not guarantee that:
          </p>
          <ul class="mt-2 list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
            <li>any particular Provider will approve your order;</li>
            <li>quoted pricing, terms, or promotions will remain available at a later date; or</li>
            <li>any service will be delivered within a particular time frame.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-2">
            Final availability, pricing, terms, and installation timeframes are solely determined by the Provider and subject to their own contracts and processes.
